# PyDE: A Python implementation of Differential Evolution procedure for unconstrained optimization

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/volpatto/pyde.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/volpatto/pyde)

Here I provide a simple Python 3.6 implementation of Differential Evolution procedure to solve unconstrained optimization problems.
Although SciPy already provides this method, I implemented it myself mainly for learning purpose.

Nonetheless, an open code, flexible to customization, can benefits students, researchers or anyone who desires to implement the DE method. Aiming to fulfill gap, I provide the present code.

In development, I try to mantain an implementation as good as possible accordling to best pratices in Python.
