Here I provide a simple Python 3.6 implementation of Differential Evolution procedure to solve unconstrained optimization problems.
Although SciPy already provides this method, an open code, flexible to customization, can benefits students, researchers or anyone who desires to implement the DE method. Aiming to fulfill this gap, I provide the present code.

In development, I try to keep an implementation as good as possible accordling to best pratices in Python. To account such project quality requirement, I strongly recommend read ["The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python"](https://www.google.com), section "Writing Great Python Code".
